	<h1>Time and Space Complexity Explained</h1>
    <p>Time complexity, often denoted as O(n), gauges algorithmic efficiency by measuring how its execution time scales with input size. efficient algorithms exhibit linear time complexity, denoted as O(n), indicating a proportional relationship between input size and time taken.</p>
    <p><b>Space complexity</b> evaluates algorithm efficiency based on the amount of memory it requires as input size grows, denoted as O(n). Efficient algorithms with O(n) space complexity manage memory usage linearly, ensuring a proportional increase alongside input expansion.</p>
